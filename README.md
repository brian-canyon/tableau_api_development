The purpose of this project is to share some of Tableau API development I have
curated. The high level summary of this project revolves around using the
Tableau supported library 'TableauServerClient' in python. Tableau is a visual
analytics platform transforming the way we use data to solve problemsâ€”empowering
people and organizations to make the most of their data.

The use case for this development arrised when attempting to migrate a Tableau
enviroment to both a newer version of Tableau, that was also part of a larger 
server migration from a VM hosting RH7 to RH8. I never could quite identify
why some of the out of the box solutions for server migrations did not work,
however, even with trail alongside a cloud team, we were forced to go with
API development. I was tasked with this migration with moderate support
from a network engineer.

Tableau has a wide variety of metadata that can be passed through the API,
below is a list of the various relevant data variables showcased in this project:

    - Users
    - User Groups (access control, ACL)
    - Projects (file folders)
    - Data Sources
    - Workbooks

The bulk of this project will focus on migrating data from one Tableau enviroment to
another. This should provide a framework for anyone looking to migrate enviroments 
themselves and wants a bit more customizability. 

While Tableau does support documentation for this library, the amount of code snip
examples are few and far between. Specifically in situations where elements of 
a Tableau server want to be copied to a different enviroment, this project
should provide the reader with an extensive blueprint of what is possible.
