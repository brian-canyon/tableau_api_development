The purpose of this project is to share some of Tableau API development I have
curated. The high level summary of this project revolves around using the
Tableau supported library 'TableauServerClient' in python. Tableau is a visual
analytics platform transforming the way we use data to solve problemsâ€”empowering
people and organizations to make the most of their data.

Tableau has a wide variety of metadata that can be passed through the API,
below is a list of the various relevant data variables showcased in this project:

    - Users
    - User Groups (access control, ACL)
    - Projects (file folders)
    - Data Sources
    - Workbooks

The bulk of this project will focus on migrating data from one Tableau enviroment to
another. This should provide a framework for anyone looking to migrate enviroments 
themselves and wants a bit more customizability.
